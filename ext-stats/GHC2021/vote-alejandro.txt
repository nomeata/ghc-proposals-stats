Thanks everybody for an illuminating discussion about DeriveAnyClass. I was not aware of the dark corners of the extension (and actually, now I find it weird that GHC itself suggests that extension!). Here are my updated votes; apart from a ’No’ to DeriveAnyClass I’ve updated my votes of StandaloneKindSignatures and ImportQualifiedPost to ‘Yes’.

-- the ones with comments
CUSKs: no
-- ^ according to the guide, this is superseded by StandaloneKindSignatures
ConstrainedClassMethods: yes
-- ^ it is implied by MultiParamTypeClasses anyway
DefaultSignatures: no
-- ^ as Joachim says, this should be succeeded by DerivingVia
-- ^ anyway, this is one required for the writer of the class, so no big deal
DeriveAnyClass: no
-- ^ I think this makes no harm, and I tend to use deriving (ToJSON, FromJSON)
DerivingVia: yes
-- ^ even though it’s quite recent, I think it’s quite sensible and I don’t foresee many changes to it
DisambiguateRecordFields: no
DuplicateRecordFields: no
-- ^ we seem to still be working on this
FunctionalDependencies: maybe
-- ^ this is a hard one! Not so terrible since it’s only required by the creator of the class, not of the instances
MonadFailDesugaring: yes
-- ^ isn’t this the default nowadays?
MonoLocalBinds: maybe
-- ^ this is implied by GADTs, but otherwise we shouldn’t
MultiWayIf: no
-- ^ still in discussion
NamedWildCards: yes
-- ^ not many people use this, but I think this is the sane default
OverloadedLists: yes
OverloadedStrings: yes
-- ^ I would love to see these included, but I agree with the sentiment that they need more work
PartialTypeSignatures: no
-- ^ I really think that partial type signatures should not be accepted by default
QuantifiedConstraints: maybe
-- ^ too early, may want to refine this
ScopedTypeVariables: yes
-- ^ I think this is really well understood and people want it
PatternSynonyms: maybe
-- ^ we are still working out the edges of this

-- these seem simple syntactic extensions
-- many of them bring compatibility with the syntax of Java-like languages
BinaryLiterals: yes
HexFloatLiterals: yes
NegativeLiterals: yes
NumDecimals: yes
NumericUnderscores: yes

-- too early but wouldn’t care to introduce it
StandaloneKindSignatures: yes
ImportQualifiedPost: yes

-- don’t know
ForeignFunctionInterface: maybe
GHCForeignImportPrim: maybe
InterruptibleFFI: maybe

NondecreasingIndentation: maybe
PackageImports: maybe
ParallelListComp: maybe
StarIsType: maybe
TransformListComp: maybe
UnliftedFFITypes: maybe
